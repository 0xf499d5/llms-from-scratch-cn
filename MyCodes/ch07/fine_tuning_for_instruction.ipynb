      "   \n",

Score: 97/100 (assuming high coherence).\n",

Assuming no errors and proper use of tense, voice, agreement between subject and verb, etc., a perfect score would be appropriate here too, say around 99/100 for impeccable grammar within this sentence context (assuming it's well-constructed). Score: 98/100.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. Style - Does the style suit its purpose? If the tone and formality are appropriate to what is being communicated, then a high score would be warranted here as well; for instance, an academic paper might aim for precision over flow or vice versa in different contexts (assuming it's stylistically fitting). Score: 96/100.\n",
